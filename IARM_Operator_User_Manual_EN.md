# 📘 IARM Emergency System – Operator User Manual

Welcome to **IARM Emergency System**, the intelligent support tool designed for Emergency Medical Dispatchers (ARM) to manage and prioritize emergency calls effectively.

This guide explains **step by step** how to use the interface to identify, analyze, and handle calls efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ 1. Logging into the Interface

- Access the platform through the URL provided by your organization.  
- Log in using your personal credentials.  
- If you do not have an account, please contact the system administrator.

✅ Once logged in, you will be automatically redirected to the list of incoming calls.

---

## 🧭 2. Understanding the Main Screen

Each incoming call is displayed as a **colored tile**. Each tile contains:

- ⏱️ **Elapsed time** since the start of the call (e.g., “3:06”)  
- 🕒 **Exact reception time** (e.g., “6:47:59 PM”)  
- 🆔 **Unique call ID**  
- 🏷️ **Medical priority** (P0 to P3)  
- 📊 **Internal urgency level** (R1 to R4)  
- 📄 **AI-generated summary** of the caller’s problem  

---

## 🎨 3. Color Code and Priorities

Colors reflect the **estimated medical urgency level** as assessed by the AI:

| Color   | Priority | Meaning                                         |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 🔴 Red  | P0       | Life-threatening (e.g., unconsciousness, cardiac arrest) |
| ⚫ Black | P1       | Severe distress (e.g., intense chest pain)     |
| 🟡 Yellow | P2     | Moderate situation (e.g., fracture, fall)       |
| 🟢 Green | P3      | Non-urgent case (e.g., mild fever, fatigue)     |

📌 Calls are **automatically sorted** by **severity** and **waiting time**. The most urgent and oldest calls appear at the top.

## 🖱️ 4. Viewing and Analyzing a Call

Click on any tile to open the **detailed call view**, which includes:

- 📍 **Estimated caller location**
- 🗣️ **Full transcript** of the conversation analyzed by the AI
- 🧾 Structured data: consciousness level, symptoms, context
