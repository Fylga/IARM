# 🧠 IARM – Intelligent Assistant for Medical Regulation

**IARM (Intelligent Assistant for Medical Regulation)** is an AI-driven system designed to assist emergency medical dispatchers (ARM) in handling and prioritizing incoming emergency calls.
The system leverages speech recognition and natural language processing to extract critical information, classify severity, and help operators triage efficiently — even during high call volumes.

## 🎯 Project Goal

> Reduce emergency response time and optimize triage by supporting ARMs with intelligent, real-time assistance during calls.

IARM improves emergency care by:
- Transcribing emergency calls in real-time
- Extracting structured medical information (location, symptoms, consciousness level, etc.)
- Classifying calls by severity (P0 to P3) and internal urgency (R1 to R4)
- Displaying calls in a clear, color-coded interface for fast operator action
